# Span-news-detection-system
This project focuses on detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. It is designed to process and classify news articles based on their content to identify whether they are fake or genuine. The project leverages a dataset with labeled news articles, which are preprocessed and then fed into a machine learning pipeline to train a classification model. Key features of the project include:

1. Data Collection: The dataset consists of thousands of news articles labeled as "Real" or "Fake," along with additional metadata such as subjects and dates.
2. Preprocessing: Data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization steps are applied to prepare the text for modeling.
3. Modeling: Several machine learning algorithms are tested and evaluated, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or potentially more complex models like neural networks, to determine which performs best for the fake news classification task.
4. Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable detection of fake news.
5. Results: Final results and conclusions about the model's performance are documented, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
   
The project showcases how machine learning can be applied to combat misinformation by developing systems that automatically detect deceptive content in news articles.
